JavaFX Ball Game - Completed Mar 2023

Animated game coded in JavaFX for more practice with inner classes, event handling and timers. A ball slowly crosses the screen from left to right and the user can click on it, incrementing their score counter by one. The game ends when the user misses 5 balls, with the number of missed balls being shown on a counter. With each successful click on a ball, the ball resets it's starting position to off screen and the velocity increases, thus upping the difficulty as the game progresses. Buttons are provided to both pause the current state of the game and reset the whole game.
